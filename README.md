# lncRNA-compGenomics
Using CREMA to identify lncRNAs in diverse plant species

This repository contains supplemental files to accompany the manuscript "Long non-protein coding RNAs from diverse plant species show evidence of phylogenetic relationships". 
Specifically, gtf annotation files and ranked lncRNA CSVs for all tested species will be stored here for use by other researchers interested in lncRNAs.
